=== 1.3.0 / 2011-06-10

* Added binary operators: + - * / between two ContinuedFractions and a ContinuedFraction and a number (on the right-hand-side).  Returns a ContinuedFraction.
* Added tests for operators.

=== 1.2.3 / 2011-06-09

* Fixed emplementation of #convergent to match its definition.
* Added exception on #convergent to be raised when index is less than 1.
* Added mention of ContinuedFractions#convergents_as_rationals in README
* Changed README example.  Variable real changed to pi.

=== 1.2.2 / 2010-03-27

* Moved repo to Git.

=== 1.2.1 / 2010-03-18

* Updated README file to display change in return class of ContinuedFractions#convergents.

=== 1.2.0 / 2010-03-18

* Changed parameter signature of ContinuedFraction#convergents_as_rationals.  Added a nth parameter to select the length of the convergents to return.

=== 1.1.0 / 2010-03-18

* Changed the public class representation of convergents from an array of Rationals to an array of arrays.
* Removed convergents_array (unnecessary since ContinuedFraction#convergents now returns an array).
* Added ContinuedFraction#convergents_as_rationals which facilitate returning convergents as Rationals.
* Changed names of index variables to be more descriptive.
* Changed documentation to reflect change of class type returned by ContinuedFraction#convergents.
* Changed tests to deal with new class type returned by ContinuedFraction#convergents.

=== 0.1.12 / 2010-03-18

* Added examples in the documentation.
* Moved convergents to the Class level to make it accessible to use with any quotient array passed to it.


=== 0.1.11 / 2010-03-16

* Changed names of some variable to provide better in-code documentation.

=== 0.1.10 / 2010-03-16

* Improved documentation and formatting.

* Including spec files in distribution (forgot to add them to the manifest).

=== 0.1.6 / 2010-03-15

* Refactored code generating matrix that holds convergences. Renamed the method convergence_matrix.
* In calculate_convergences, refactored multiple occurances of i-1 and i-2, assigning the values to variables at the top of the iterations.

=== 0.1.5 / 2010-03-15

* Minor changes to README
* Added :nodoc: to Matrix singleton class method.

=== 0.1.4 / 2010-03-15
